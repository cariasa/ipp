  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical model of situation awareness based
	on its role in dynamic human decision making in a variety of domains.
	Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system
	operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship
	between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental
	factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory
	are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring
	and interpreting information from the environment to form situation
	awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized
	as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of
	design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation
	on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors
	in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented.
	The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator
	situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness
	research.},

  abstract = {{Research on democratic party competition in the formal spatial tradition
	of Downs and the comparative-historical tradition of Lipset and Rokkan
	assumes that linkages of accountability and responsiveness between
	voters and political elites work through politicians' programmatic
	appeals and policy achievements. This ignores, however, alternative
	voter-elite linkages through the personal charisma of political leaders
	and, more important, selective material incentives in networks of
	direct exchange (clientelism). In light of the diversity of linkage
	mechanisms appearing in new democracies and changing linkages in
	established democracies, this article explores theories of linkage
	choice. It first develops conceptual definitions of charismatic,
	clientelist, and programmatic linkages between politicians and electoral
	constituencies. It then asks whether politicians face a trade-off
	or mutual reinforcement in employing linkage mechanisms. The core
	section of the article details developmentalist, statist, institutional,
	political-economic, and cultural-ideological theories of citizen-elite
	linkage formation in democracies, showing that none of the theories
	is fully encompassing. The final section considers empirical measurement
	problems in comparative research on linkage.}},

  title = {Statistical detection of systematic election irregularities},
  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Democratic societies are built around the principle of free and fair
	elections, and that each citizen’s vote should count equally. National
	elections can be regarded as large-scale social experiments, where
	people are grouped into usually large numbers of electoral districts
	and vote according to their preferences. The large number of samples
	implies statistical consequences for the polling results, which can
	be used to identify election irregularities. Using a suitable data
	representation, we find that vote distributions of elections with
	alleged fraud show a kurtosis substantially exceeding the kurtosis
	of normal elections, depending on the level of data aggregation.
	As an example, we show that reported irregularities in recent Russian
	elections are, indeed, well-explained by systematic ballot stuffing.
	We develop a parametric model quantifying the extent to which fraudulent
	mechanisms are present. We formulate a parametric test detecting
	these statistical properties in election results. Remarkably, this
	technique produces robust outcomes with respect to the resolution
	of the data and therefore, allows for cross-country comparisons.},

  abstract = {The analytical, conceptual, and political framework of development
	is changing dramatically. The new development agenda calls for broader
	understandings of sectors, countries, development strategies, and
	policies. It emphasizes learning and continuous feedback at all phases
	of the development cycle. As the development agenda grows in scope
	and complexity, development evaluation follows suit. Development
	evaluator are moving away from traditional implementation and output-focused
	evaluation models toward results-based evaluation models, as the
	development community calls for results and embraces the millennium
	development goals. As the development community shifts its focus
	away from projects in order to comprehensively address country challenges,
	development evaluators are seeking methods with which to assess results
	at the country, sector, theme, policy, and even global levels. As
	the development community recognizes the importance of not only a
	comprehensive but also a coordinated approach to developing country
	challenges and emphasizes partnerships, development evaluators are
	increasingly engaged in joint evaluations. These joint evaluations,
	while advantageous in many respects, add to the complexity of development
	evaluation (OECD 2006). Additionally, development evaluators increasingly
	face the measurement challenge of determining the performance of
	an individual development organization in this broader context and
	of identifying its contribution. This text is intended as a tool
	for use in building development evaluation capacity. It aims to help
	development evaluators think about and explore the new evaluation
	architecture and especially to design and conduct evaluations that
	focus on results in meeting the challenges of development.},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {As with the other presidential elections from this decade, the 2008
	election was followed by considerable speculation as to how new efforts
	to mobilize voters affected the eventual outcome. Although the conventional
	wisdom implies that “Democrats benefit from higher turnout,” previous
	research in political science demonstrates that such a conclusion
	applies to actual election results inconsistently. In this article,
	we outline the difficulties involved with assessing turnout effects
	within a particular election and proceed to test the hypothesis that
	the Obama campaign benefited from higher turnout using three different
	methods. The evidence suggests that the Obama campaign benefited
	substantially from voter turnout, particularly in comparison with
	the Kerry campaign in 2004, yet they also were successful in changing
	the minds of already mobilized voters. Although various data difficulties
	suggest the presence of some bias in our estimates, the consistency
	of the results across tests supports the general conclusion.},
